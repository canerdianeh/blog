[![Veeam]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2011/05/veeam_logo.gif)](http://blog.ianbeyer.com/files/2011/05/veeam_logo.gif)[![Hyper-V]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2011/05/Windows-Server-2008-Hyper-V-logo-v_2-300x133.png)](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/hyperv-main.aspx)It's official - [Veeam](http://www.veeam.com "Veeam") is announcing this morning that version 6 of their award-winning backup/replication software will support Microsoft's [Hyper-V](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/hyperv-main.aspx "Hyper-V") virtualization hypervisor. The new version is due out later this year.

## What's Cool about Veeam and Hyper-V

[Veeam](http://www.veeam.com "Veeam") is once again delivering IT magic by building their own Changed Block Tracking functionality into Hyper-V for some of the highly efficient backup and replication that Veeam is known for. This is going to go a long way toward bringing Microsoft virtualization up to par with [VMware](http://www.vmware.com "VMWare"). Also included are file-level restore and virtual lab provisioning, as well as SCOM integration.

For non-profits, this is potentially huge, since it brings advanced backup capabilities to the hypervisor that's included with Windows Server. VMWare is great technology, but for SMB and non-profits, VMWare's pricing point is painful. When non-profit/education customers can get Windows Datacenter licenses for around $300 a socket (which includes Hyper-V!), suddenly VMWare looks *really* painful, even after educational discount.

## What's still missing

The initial release will not include Veeam's U-AIR capability, but they're hard at work to bring that capability online.

It also lacks the ability to back up/replicate across virtualization platforms, but that's to be expected.

Veeam hasn't yet announced pricing/licensing details. What I'd really like to see from Veeam is a per-socket license that is platform-independent.

If you haven't yet experienced the awesomeness that is Veeam, give the folks at [Mirazon](http://www.mirazon.com "Mirazon") a call. Those guys know Veeam up and down and backwards.
